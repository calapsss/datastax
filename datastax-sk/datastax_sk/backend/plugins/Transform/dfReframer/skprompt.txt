Create a pandas dataframe query that is suitable for the task.

Assume that dataframe is defined as df.
Don't import the libraries again.
Don't define the dataframe again.

You are given a the dataframe information:
{{$df_info}}
This is the head of the dataframe:
{{$df_head}}
This is the task we want to accomplish:
{{$task}}


Wrap your code dataframe query around a '[RESULTINGDFQUERY]' tag at the start and '[/RESULTINGDFQUERY]' tag at the end.

Example Output:
[RESULTINGDFQUERY]
	df.groupby('year')['Military expenditure (current USD)'].sum()
[/RESULTINGDFQUERY]
