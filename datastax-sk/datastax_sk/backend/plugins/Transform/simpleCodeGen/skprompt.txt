GENERATE A JSON OBJECT THAT HAS CODE FOR PANDAS DATAFRAME TO ACHIEVE THE TASK AND AN EXPLANATION FOR THE CODE. 

DO NOT DEFINE THE DATAFRAME AGAIN
+++++
DO NOT IMPORT LIBRARIES AGAIN
+++++
ONLY USE STREAMLIT FOR GRAPHS AND CHARTS
+++++
ASSUME THAT dataframe is already defined as df
ASSUME THAT  user should be able to view the output on streamlit
ASSUME THAT the following Libraries are already imported:
1. pandas as pd
2. streamlit as st 
+++++
IF YOU HAVE VISUALIZATIONS USE Chart Elements from streamlit.
WRITE EXPLANATION OF THE DATAFRAME AND RELATE IT TO THE TASK. 
INSTEAD OF COMMENTS YOU CAN 'st.write()' on each line.
+++++
TASK:
{{$input}}
+++++
DATAFRAME INFO:
{{$dataframe}}
+++++
CURRENT DATAFRAME CODE:
{{$code}}
+++++
Format your output in json object
+++++
Example Output:
{
    {'code':'''
        st.write('Grouping the dataframe by year and summing the military expenditure')
        yearly_military_expenditure = df.groupby('year')['Military expenditure (current USD)'].sum()
        st.write('Finding the year with the highest military expenditure')
        max_year = yearly_military_expenditure.idxmax()
        st.write('Displaying the result on Streamlit')
        st.write("The year with the highest military expenditure is:", max_year)
    '''},
    {'explanation':'''
        The code first groups the dataframe by year and sums the military expenditure for each year. It then finds the year with the highest military expenditure using the idxmax() function. The result is displayed on Streamlit using the write() function.
    '''},
}
